1. What is one advantage of MergeSort compared to QuickSort, and one advantage of QuickSort?
MergeSort has a higher performance output since it is able to divide larger tasks into smaller ones through recursion. QuickSort allows for smaller memory utilization by correctly sorting via aa pivot value.

2. What sorting algorithm is the default, built-in algorithm used by Python? (Use the Internet to track this down.) Briefly describe how it works.
Python utilizes TimSort, which is a combination of Binary Insertion Sort (where data is inserted in an array) and MergeSort (where data is split up and sorted)

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
I learned that "copying" a class does not mean I copied the values of that class.

I assisted one of my teammates in Slack with their code.
