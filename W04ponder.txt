Your Name: Doug Irwin

1. Besides the obvious aspect of writing fewer lines of code, what is a benefit of having a method call the methods of an internal object, as opposed to doing the work itself? (E.g., Why is it beneficial for the get_subtotal method of the Order class to make use of methods from the Product class?)
Organization - this helps with keeping code more maintainable

2. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
Compacting code into a tar file. For some reason, I had a hard time understanding why it didn't work until I realized I was compacting my main file.
