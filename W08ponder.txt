1. In your own words, describe encapsulation.
Containing data within an object to prevent unintentional value modification

2. What is a benefit of using a property instead of just having a setter function (e.g., set_angle(45))?
It allows access to methods as if they were attributes to the object, thereby allowing other programmers to utilize the code easier.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
I really enjoy seeing how much cleaner it is to look at a property declaration rather than a getter and setter

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
I was able to hop onto Zoom to assist two other classmate with their code

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
