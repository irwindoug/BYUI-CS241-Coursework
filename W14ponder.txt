Your Name: Doug Irwin

1. In your own words, please describe object-oriented programming and explain why it is useful.
Object-oriented programming is a way of separating different pieces of code into segments based around the functionality of the object. It is useful because it helps make it easier to maintain and reuse code.

2. Of all the different data structures we discussed, which one do you think is the "coolest" and why?
MergeSort, because I think it is fascinating to use recursion to split data in half down to smaller increments and merge them together.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned this semester?
I found creating a batch script that creates an html file based on the system variables

4. If this course included three more weeks, what additional topic(s) would you like to learn about?
I would have really enjoyed learning how to use Python along with the bash scripts that we learned towards the end of the semester.

5. What was the biggest misconception you had about this material prior to this semester?
That Python would not be very interesting or useful in a programming atmosphere

6. Do you have any final questions/comments for your instructor?
