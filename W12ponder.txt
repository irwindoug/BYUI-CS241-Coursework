1. What is your favorite thing about working with Pandas?
I really enjoyed being able to create charts out of the data and be able to see my work in a visual format

Some of the functionality is NOT intuitive. I learned that by grouping my data together, Panda drops some of the columns it deems as non-essential (more or less)
