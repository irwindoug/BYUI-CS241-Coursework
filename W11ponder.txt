Your Name: Doug Irwin

1. In your own words describe polymorphism.
It basically is taking something that has a base level and being able to shape it into multiple different functionalities. 

2. Briefly describe how polymorphism is used in your project.
Everything from my basic code that appeared on screen inherited from a single class called FlyingObject, even though a lot of the functionality changed between a bullet, a ship, or an asteroid. Then, each asteroid also changed functionality based on whether it was a small, medium, or large asteroid. I was able to change each characteristic, even though all of the objects shared similar basic variables and functionalities.

3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
I learned that there was a way (though I did not implement it) to remove an object within an array based from within the class through inherited functionality from the arcade library.

4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
I reached out to Brother Mellor to ask about why my asteroid objects were not breaking apart correctly, only to learn that I was copying a class instead of the class variables, which cased the broken functionality.

5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
