1. Take a minute to search the Internet for an explanation of "polymorphism". You might especially consider sources such as StackOverflow and Wikipedia. After reading through some of these, in your own words, describe polymorphism AND why it's useful.
It basically is taking something that has a base level and being able to shape it into multiple different functionalities. It helps guide a developer, or multiples, in being able to create different types of objects, but still be able to know what functionality is utilized within the code.

2. What is the benefit of making an empty abstract method in a base class?
To avoid confusing it as one that has basic functionality. It causes the developer not to rely on the main template.

I REALLY enjoyed learning about polymorphism, utilizing it ot make
